### Hallos, beautiful one 😄👋

I love the web as much as you do, building accessible and responsive UIs is a jam I can dance to all day. Learning is a thing around here and grateful to the teachers who make time to put out great resource 📖.

***note: the list is not exhaustive, a lot of amazing people to gain insight from*** 

I am learning and contributing to [@mdnwebdocs](https://github.com/mdn/content). My favourite thing about the web is CSS, seeing it evolve has made me appreciate time 🕰️, humble beginnings 🔰 and adventures 🧳. On days I am not coding you can catch me reading 🛋️ or sleeping 😴, I hope you are getting some sleep 😄. 

Thank you for dropping by my spot 😄🙏🏼, be light and may joy surround you.
